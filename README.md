======

*rmagic* is a Ruby on Rails implementation of Magic the Gathering.

The engine barely supports anything at the moment, but it's a start.

## Features

* [Lots of tests](spec/games/) and [cucumber features](features/) and [Capybara](features/ui/)
* (Hopefully) amazingly clean code
* Declare attackers and defenders
* Tapping cards for mana
* Instants from cards, abilities from creatures, targeting both cards and players
* Temporary effects modifying power/toughness on creatures
* Activated abilities considering summoning sickness
* Spells and creatures interacting on the stack
* Enchantments attached to cards
* Counter spells
* Deck shuffling and drawing
* Mulligans
* Random first player
* Basic multiplayer interface with OAuth2 login
* Javascript REST-driven to enable a rich user experience
* Card graphics
* Flying, reach, devotion, lifelink, trample, monstrous
* Games can end, be won, be lost, be drawn
* After a period of inactivity, passes can be requested

## ActiveRecord concepts

We try to use as few model objects as possible.

* `Card` - cards
* `Effect` - temporary and permanent effects on cards
* `Player` - life, unspent mana
* `Duel` - current player, phase
* `Battlefield`, `Deck`, `Graveyard`, `Hand`, `Exile` - zones where `Card`s are
* `ActionLog` - something that happened (optionally with many `ActionLogTarget`s) - try and do everything with ActionLogs (e.g. `draw`, `tap`, `untap`, `attack`, `defend`)
* `DeclaredAttacker`, `DeclaredDefender` - temporary wrappers around declared attackers, defenders

## TODO

* Activated abilities actually go on the stack
* Support more game phases correctly
* Summoning sickness for activated abilities
* Sorceries
* Display counters on cards on web interface
* Token creatures
* Look at [bullet](https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet) or [rack-mini-profiler](https://github.com/MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler) to improve game performance

## Release 0 goals

## Release 1 goals

* Supports [Fate vs Fury](http://sales.starcitygames.com/carddisplay.php?product=695013) deck
* Scry
* User-assigned damage distribution
* Search through library
* Discard a card
* Maximum hand size
* Event triggers

## Later goals

* Specify resolved attack priority order
* An AI that makes sense
* Support exile zone
* User chat

## Probably never

* More than two player games
* Different game modes
* Data-driven cards, rather than [in Ruby](app/cards/)
* Comparison of supported features to the [comprehensive rules](http://magiccards.info/rules.html)

## Development

When developing, you'll want three terminals running each of:

* `rails server` - to catch changes in the Rails app
* `grunt serve` - to catch changes in the React app
* `guard` - to enable [LiveReload](https://mattbrictson.com/lightning-fast-sass-reloading-in-rails)

### Ubuntu

[Install MySQL as necessary](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-mysql-with-your-ruby-on-rails-application-on-ubuntu-14-04) before running `bundle`:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev
sudo mysql_install_d
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

### Mac OS X

If running El Capitan, you may need to `brew link openssl --force`.

## Deployment

* `sudo apt-get install ruby-sass php5-cli`
* Install [NodeJS](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)
* `npm install -g grunt grunt-cli`
* Install composer [as well](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
* Install Redis [as a service](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart) as well

If using a user `deploy`, you can deploy [with Capistrano](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/deploying-a-rails-app-on-ubuntu-14-04-with-capistrano-nginx-and-puma) by running `cap production deploy`.

Edit `/env/environment` or `.env` to set up your environment variables.
Make sure to run `cap puma:stop` and `cap puma:start` for Puma to pick up updated environment.

### Sample `/env/environment` or `.env`

```
MYSQL_USERNAME="xxx"
MYSQL_PASSWORD="yyy"
SECRET_KEY_BASE="zzz"
SECRET_TOKEN="abc"
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="123.google.com"
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="abc123"
APPLICATION_CONFIG_SECRET_TOKEN="abc123"
WEBSOCKET_LOCATION="your.host:3001/websocket"
```

* For `OAUTH_CLIENT_*` variables, get these from your [Google OAuth2 parameters](http://www.jevon.org/wiki/Google_OAuth2_with_Ruby_on_Rails) (step 5)

## Tests

```
rake spec
cucumber
```
